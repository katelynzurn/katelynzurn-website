        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Katelyn Zurn.  I have a passion for learning, which fuels my career as an engineer and is the driving force
            behind my curious and eager approach to life.  I graduated from the College of Saint Benedict in 2017 with a degree in
            Computer Science and Mathematics.  I am a passionate software engineer with a love for solving complex problems and building
            innovative solutions. With experience in full-stack development, I enjoy creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly
            applications. I am always looking to grow my skill set and collaborate with others to bring new ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe the key to leading a successful and meaningful life is to be a well-rounded person.  By day, I am a software engineer
            at Securian Financial.  I spend a majority of my spare time being active, which includes frequenting the gym and participating in
            various sports and outdoor activities.  I have 3 miniature dachshunds that I consider my "children with fur". I take time to volunteer,
            and express my artistic side through painting and playing musical instruments.  I entertain my adventurous side by traveling whenever
            possible.  Above all, I make sure to experience these moments with the people I love.
        </p>
